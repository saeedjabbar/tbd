  

**Decentralized Identifiers(DIDs):** A new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. You can read more about the standard [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

**Decentralized Web Nodes:** A decentralized personal and application data storage and message relay node, as defined in the DIF Decentralized Web Node specification. Users may have multiple Nodes that replicate their data between them. You can read more about this standard [here](https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/).


**Identity Hubs:** Identity Hubs are a data storage and message relay mechanism entities can use to locate public or permissioned private data related to a given DID.

  

**Off-ramp:** Exchanging cryptocurrencies for fiat money.

  

**On-ramp:** Exchanging fiat money for cryptocurrencies.

  

**Participating Financial Institutions(PFIs):**  Entities that offer liquidity services on the tbDEX network. They are identified by their decentralized identifiers(DIDs) and verifiable credentials(VCs).


**tbDEX:** A protocol for discovering liquidity and exchanging assets (such as bitcoin, fiat money, or real world goods) when the existence of social trust is an intractable element of managing transaction risk.

  

**Verifiable Credentials(VCs):** Provides a standard way to express credentials across the digital world in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine verifiable. You can read more about the standard [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/).

  

**Wallets:** Digital wallets allow for the storage, verification, and transactions of digital assets such as currencies, nfts, etc. In the tbdex protocol, wallets act as agents for individuals or institutions by facilitating exchanges with participating financial institutions. 



**Web5:** A Decentralized Web Platform that enables developers to leverage Decentralized Identifiers(DIDs), Verifiable Credentials(VCs), and
Decentralized Web Nodes to write Decentralized Web Apps, returning ownership and control over identity and data to individuals.
