# Getting Started 

So you've heard of web5 and want to get started, well you've found the right place. We will first explore what is web5 and then look at the various building blocks of web5.

## What is Web5?

The ethos of Web5 is giving the user back control of their data. It envisions a future where a user can own their data and migrate it seamlessly to a new platform. For example you can take all your photos from Flickr to Instgram and vice versa. 

This new version of the web will be powered by decentralized applications and protocols. One of the first protocols will be tbdex. Other elements of Web5 include Decentralized Identifiers(DIDs), Verifiable Credentials(VCs), and **Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN). 

You can [read](https://developer.tbd.website/blog/what-is-web5/) the full write up of what is Web5 by Angie Jones, VP of Global Developer Relations at TBD. Additional the presentation for What is Web5 can be found [here](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/Decentralized%20Web%20Platform%20-%20Public.pdf).

### TBDex

A protocol for discovering liquidity and exchanging assets (such as bitcoin, fiat money, or real world goods) when the existence of social trust is an intractable element of managing transaction risk. It's important to know that the tbdex protocol is a messaging protocol at it's core and not a blockchain.

### Decentralized Identifiers(DIDs) 

A new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. You can read more about the standard [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

### Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN)

A decentralized personal and application data storage and message relay node, as defined in the DIF Decentralized Web Node specification. Users may have multiple Nodes that replicate their data between them. You can read more about this standard [here](https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">DIDs are a new type of identifier that do not require a centralized registry. It empowers everyone on the Web to generate their own identifiers and take control of their own <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/identity?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#identity</a> and relationships while also providing greater <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/security?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#security</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/privacy?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#privacy</a> <a href="https://t.co/L4Vrdc3YhV">pic.twitter.com/L4Vrdc3YhV</a></p>&mdash; W3C Developers (@w3cdevs) <a href="https://twitter.com/w3cdevs/status/1549453561754537985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

### Verifiable Credentials(VCs)

Provides a standard way to express credentials across the digital world in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine verifiable. You can read more about the standard [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/).



## Roadmap

You can find the roadmap for Web5 on the official TBD [blog](https://developer.tbd.website/assets/images/web5-roadmap-b219d4c18ef6a67a719c34220df60d15.jpeg). At the end of Q3 of 2022, the team is expected to ship the SSI SDK, SSI Service, and Decentralize Web Nodes.

## Contribute

For developers, you can review and contribute to Web5 at the official TBD Github page [here](https://github.com/TBD54566975). 

While the rest of the tooling for web5 are under development you can get started with the Self-Sovereign Identity Services and create your first DID. Frank Hinek's tutorial is a great place to start and took me under 5 minutes to setup. You can find his tutorial [here](https://frankhinek.com/getting-started-with-tbds-ssi-service/).
