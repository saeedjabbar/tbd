# Getting Started 

So you've heard of web5 and want to get started, well you've found the right place. We will first explore what is web5 and then look at the various building blocks of web5.

## What is Web5?

The glue that holds Web5 together is the tbdex protocol. 

### TBDex
It's important to know that the tbdex protocol is a messaging protocol at it's core and not a blockchain.

### DIDs


While the rest of the tooling for web5 are under development you can get started with the Self-Sovereign Identity Services and create your first DID. Frank Hinek's tutorial is a great place to start and took me under 5 minutes to setup. You can find his tutorial [here](https://frankhinek.com/getting-started-with-tbds-ssi-service/).
